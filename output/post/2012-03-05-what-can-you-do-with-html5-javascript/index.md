- You can build mobile apps with [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com "PhoneGap Build"). [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/ "jQuery Mobile") makes it really easy. You can deploy to the market place in Apple's app store, and Android's, and others so quickly your head will spin.
- Build large scale client side web applications. Frameworks like [Backbone JS](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/ "Backbone JS"), [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/ "KnockoutJS") make this much simpler.
- Access large scale data installations. JavaScript is now a first class citizen with regards to data access - whether you're hitting MongoDB, CouchDB, or RavenDB. Or, even [WCF-RIA](http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2011/04/13/RIAJS-jQuery-client-for-WCF-RIA-Services.aspx "WCF-RIA jQuery ") or [OData](http://www.odata.org/developers/odata-sdk "OData") to access .NET based data sources.
- Develop screaming fast scalable web back end services using [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/ "NodeJS").
- Securely and effectively process payments with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js "Stripe.JS") or even TSYS MultiPASS.
- Develop Native Windows 8 apps with [Chakra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Runtime#JavaScript).

I'm not sure this can be overstated: never in my career has one skill set been applicable in some many areas all at once.
