See this is what I mean about Gmail.  How is this helpful?  Why did we hide the text of all of the messages, and show instead only a screenshot of the attachment?

Labels I love. Filters I love. No folders, excellent search: I'm on board!  But the Gmail thread view is a bad idea patiently executed. Give it up!
