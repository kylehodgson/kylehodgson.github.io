ThoughtWorks has finally published a new Tech Radar!

Interesting notes:

- [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) + [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) in adopt
- [Zipkin](http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/06/distributed-systems-tracing-with-zipkin.html) in assess
- [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) both in adopt
- [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) and [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) in trial

Though, the TAG wasn't so kind to all of our favorite JavaScript frameworks... check the links to find out more!
