So, now that I have a firm grasp of what's good and bad about WCF -> MSMQ, I'm going to take the evening out to review nServciceBus.  It's website isn't down, and I have a pot of tea and a stack of old CD's, so lets see how much I can figure out.  The inherent pub/sub async distributed, queued architecture promises to be easier to configure and more fault tolerant than WCF.  This should be a low bar...

And besides, there's a whopping 35 entries under the nServiceBus tag on ServerFault, so how niche can it be? ;)

As a side note, I'm listening to Grumpy's album "No Respect For Gravity".  Indeed.
