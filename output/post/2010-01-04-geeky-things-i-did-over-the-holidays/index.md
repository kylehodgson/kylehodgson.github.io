- Shopped for, and bought, a [Netbook](http://paymentnetworks.wordpress.com/2009/12/31/holiday-tech-project-new-netbook/).  Tiny laptops rock! Who knew? (edit: found [this](http://netbooked.net/netbook-reviews/review/11.6-acer-aspire-as1410-celeron-su2300-review/) afterward. It was more than I planned on spending, but in retrospect wish I'd found it earlier)
- Spent two hours writing unit tests in TCL for a pile of source code I don't know anything about.  This makes me want to learn Python for some reason.
- Wrote more code for my WCF project that I'm working on.  Knocked out a few classes and refactored the existing stuff to make it a bit more maintainable, then chewed myself out for re-writing perfectly good code.
- Bought a budget [Laser printer](http://www.okidata.com/mkt/html/nf/MFP.php?sku=MB200MFPSeries), and attached it to an old Windows XP laptop as a print server in my new home office.
- Got a haircut.  (Why is this geeky? I cut it at home!)
- Went to see Avatar! Yay 3d glasses and movies totally built for the MMO generation.  Very cool! Go see it.
- Watched the movie Moon.  Very well done!  Does not require 3d glasses.
- Wrote a blog post about Gmail.
- Played with Android phones that two family members were using. I'm impressed! They've done a sweet job.
