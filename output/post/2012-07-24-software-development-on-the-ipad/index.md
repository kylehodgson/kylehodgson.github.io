So apparently, a fellow Throne of JS conference attendee [snapped this pic](https://twitter.com/lof/status/227146414004768769/photo/1) of me using DietCoda to hack on some Ruby between presentations.

Apparently, this is not yet that common. What editor shall I try next? I'm considering Textastic. RWW has a write up on it and two others [here](http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/12/code-editors-for-the-ipad.php).
