One of the main complaints for AngularJS developers is that the documentation isn’t quite as rich as we’d like. I had the good fortune to talk to one of the members of the Angular team last night, and scribbled notes furiously. I’ve found each of the below valuable resources.

## Video Resources

### EggHead.io

[www.egghead.io](http://www.egghead.io) has a great video series on AngularJS, launched March 1st, covering a wide range of topics. Binding, controllers, filters, directives and so much more. This is a really great resource for either new Angular devs that want to know more or existing Angular devs that want to brush up on specific topics.

### Youtube Channel

[The AngularJS Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/angularjs) is a great resource for video content also. The Angular team contributes, as does the community, and there’s a lot of content available here.

## Forums, Q&A, and Mailing Lists

### The AngularJS Mailing List

If you want to drink from the firehose and be connected more directly to the team, Sign up for the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/angular](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/angular) \[AngularJS mailing list\]. It also makes a great resource for searching if your particular issue has been found before.

- [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/angular](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/angular)

### StackOverflow

StackOverflow has a [tag for AngularJS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angularjs). StackOverflow is a really great resource for Angular as you might imagine.

## Specific Documentation

### IE Bootstrapping

For developers wrestling with getting Angular to bootstrap in Internet Explorer, the IE page [in their documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie) has some great comments that talks you through what you need to do (yes, check the comments!)

### Search Engine Optimization

When projects start to think about how to work with search engine optimization, [YearOfMoo](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2012/11/angularjs-and-seo.html) has a post on this worth reading.

Additionally, Stephane Bisson has [started a project](https://github.com/stephanebisson/ngseo) that works on the SEO problem. Check it out!

### Tips & Tricks

Dean Sofer has a great blog entry with a bunch of AngularJS tips and tricks, including a nice section on [templates](http://deansofer.com/posts/view/14/AngularJs-Tips-and-Tricks-UPDATED#templates).
