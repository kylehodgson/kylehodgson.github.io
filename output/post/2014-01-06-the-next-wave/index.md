## The Current Wave

JavaScript was the “Next Wave” maybe two years ago.

- JavaScript is in [your](http://couchdb.apache.org/) [database](http://www.mongodb.org).
- JavaScript is on the [server](http://nodejs.org/).
- JavaScript is on the [client](https://www.google.ca/#q=this+doesnt+need+a+link).
- JavaScript is in your [network transport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
- JavaScript is in your [lisp](http://www.clojurescript.org).
- JavaScript is [testable](http://karma-runner.github.io/).

## The Next Wave

I think the next wave is something functional, probably [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org), for all the usual reasons: immutability by default, simple syntax, mature testing and build systems. However, my personal observations have something to do with it too. Having been involved in three different Software Craftsmanship groups over the last 24 months, I’ve noticed that when we focus on Clojure, more developers show up. If the group turns to Scala, or Erlang, or Go-lang, or anything else really, numbers drop.

I’m not known for making predictions of course, so we’ll have to see how it bears out.
