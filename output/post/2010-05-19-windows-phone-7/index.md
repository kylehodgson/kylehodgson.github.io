I checked out the Windows Phone 7 tools tonight, and I'm very happy with the current release. Visual Studio Express is one fantastic product, and Silverlight 4 is very nice. In about an hour (or two) I had a basic app going. Hit F5, and up it comes in an emulator.

I'm toying around with whipping up a little app, and I imagine us putting it in the Microsoft App Store thing. Pretty cool! Â Go, check it out.

I did a Channel 9 video on Silverlight 4 the other day, which was good preparation for working in the WP7 Silverlight environment. If you're a Silverlight Whiz already, you can probably skip it.

Here's some great starter links:
