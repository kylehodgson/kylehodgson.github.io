FinExtra reported late last week that Visa is launching a [virtual debit card program](http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=21134) in Japan.

What is this exactly?

It's a credit card number, and all of the requisite security features to perform a transaction, but no plastic card. We've also seen this approach in programs like TPG Rewards' ["e-Movie Cash™"](http://www.tpgrewards.com/content/view/13/40/) product. These products are very effective, and effecient - convenient for either online only situations (where you don't need to swipe a card) or for consumer incentive programs that drive the winner to a specific retailer of group of retailers.

Pretty cool stuff - cost effective, easy to manage, and proving highly desirable to consumers -  I'm sure as managing plastic card programs increases in cost and complexity we will be seeing more of these.
