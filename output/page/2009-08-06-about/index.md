While I love making technology, what gets me out of bed in the morning is helping people accomplish ambitious goals. Whether I'm solving organizational challenges, leading teams, writing code or presenting new concepts, I do my best to bring vision and positive energy.

A passionate, energetic speaker, I've presented a wide range of topics, including NoSQL, Lean/Agile Software Development, Continuous Delivery, ServiceStack, KnockoutJS and AngularJS. Many of my talks tend to consider a "test driven" approach, and focus on Extreme Programming techniques.
