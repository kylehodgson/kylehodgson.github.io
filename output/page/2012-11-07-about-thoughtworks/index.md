I discovered ThoughtWorks in 2011 at a group meeting of the XP Toronto group. [Sean Doran](http://seandoran.wordpress.com/) was giving a talk on agile Program Management, and I remember that his presentation was like a lightning bolt. Here was this company that seemed to think as I did, and not only had we come to similar conclusion, but they had obviously taken these practices to a much higher level. That organization was ThoughtWorks.

As I read more, and interacted with more ThoughtWorkers, I became more and more impressed. Â Happily, I joined ThoughtWorks in August of 2012. I've had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects since then, with many of the finest minds in technology today. I've travelled to the US, India, and even Africa (we have offices in [South Africa](http://join.thoughtworks.com/south-africa) and [Uganda](http://join.thoughtworks.com/uganda)) to help with projects. It's been a life changing experience.
